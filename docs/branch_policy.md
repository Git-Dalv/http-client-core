# Branch and Testing Policy

Development work is performed on the `feature/separate-branch` feature branch, and every update should include accompanying automated tests.

The `feature/separate-branch` branch now exists in the repository. If you do not see it locally, fetch or pull the latest updates and check it out with `git checkout feature/separate-branch`.
